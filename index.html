                    Aoscr's Crafting is a vannila+ type Minecraft mod that adds crafting recipies 
                    for normally uncraftable objects, and the reason for this is for exporation to be 
                    easier in starting a new modded world.

                    All of the members of the Game Development Club at Appstate hosted a Make-A-Game Day,
                    where we divded into specialized teams to develop a game in one sitting. I was on the mechanics task force for 
                    a game designed around a fising game by day, turned vampire horde survival by night.

            <p class="question"> Why the name Aoscr?</p>
            <p class="answer"> 
                Some guy really messed up by writing my first name "Oscar" as "Aoscr" for a order of coffee, 
                and apparently I believe that to be a sign from a greater power to choose that for my developer name.

        <li>
            <p class="question">When would you be available for work?</p>
            <p class="answer"> 
                I should be available for work or any opportuities once I am out of being a full-time student, so that would be this upcoming 
                summer stretch from <strong> May 10th to August 19th,</strong> and of course once I graduate <strong>after December of this year (2024)</strong>.

        <li>
            <p class="question"> What type of work opportunities would you be interested in?</p>
            <p class="answer">  
                I don't have anything specific in mind at the moment, but I will be done with all of my major computer programming and mathemtatics courses 
                for my degree and my data scraping section of my data science certificate, and although I plan to take a machine learning this fall, 
                I would be willing to work for an opportunity that involves that. 
            </p>
            <p class="answer">
                I will be done with my web development section of electives so I can see myself enjoying that out of school. I also really enjoyed database programming 
                although I know enough to know I know only a moderate amount of developing and maintaining databases. 
                
            </p>
            <p class="answer">
                Long answer short, any position that would be entry level would be suitable for my current level of experience.
                Remote work or in-person with provided transportaton would be best for me since I do not have a vehicle yet.
